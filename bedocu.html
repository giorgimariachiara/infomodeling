                            rooted in the essence of <a href="indexrenaissance.html">Renaissance style</a> manuscripts. The meticulous designs and representations, exemplified by images sourced from Europeana—a renowned digital 
                            platform offering access to an expansive collection from European cultural institutions—showcase pages from Collenuccio's seminal works: the Apologues (Agenoria, Misopenes, 
                            Alithia, and Bombarda) and Lucian's Dialogues (De raptu Europae, Galene et Panope, and De Paradis iudicio), all penned in eloquent Latin. 
                           
                            This homage to history is further embodied in the background, directly adapted from a particular manuscript page decoration. With a flourish

                            Typography plays a pivotal role in transporting the reader back in time.Two distinct fonts, Aquiline and Cinzel, are masterfully employed, 
                            chosen for their resemblance to the fonts of the original texts. <b>Cinzel</b>,
                             with its classic elegance, graces the titles, image descriptions, and even some functional parts like the navbar or metadata button. 
                             In contrast, <b>Aquiline</b>, renowned for 
                             its striking resemblance to historical handwritten scripts, brings the main text to life. An additional font that is <b>Goudy Initialen</b>,
                              ornamental in nature, adorns the initials of various
                              articles, further embedding the rich style of the period. 
                               </p>
                            
                          <p> 
                        Every textual element has been meticulously curated. Texts are <b>justified</b>, reminiscent of traditional manuscript formatting, and a generous right margin enhances the genuine ambiance.
                        Distinctive features, such as captions and underlines emphasizing individuals and locations, emulate the accentuated words commonly found in historical documents. Furthermore,
                        in keeping with the original design, a decorative sidebar has been incorporated alongside each text. The titles, too, faithfully adhere to the authentic style, with their rich burgundy 
                        backdrop complemented by gilded lettering and ornate borders. 
                            
                            
                            A notable challenge was the limited visual representation in Collenuccio's original manuscripts. To overcome this, existing images 
                            were ingeniously adapted to appear as if they were hand-drawn, maintaining fidelity to a time devoid of photography. To further enhance 
                            their ornamental appeal and achieve a cohesive aesthetic, each image is framed with a resplendent golden border

                            A different approach has been the one for the representative images of the three artists. In this case, by mirroring his distinctive depiction 
                            from the original manuscripts, I dediced to adorn each artist's photo with a delicate circular leaf border. This frame seamlessly merges with th einitial 
                            letter of each text, crafted using the Goudy Initialen font, thereby faithfully emulating the aesthetic of the original manuscript.

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p>Emporium was a renowned Italian
                            magazine dedicated to the arts and graphic design, printed in Bergamo by 
                            the Institute of Graphic Arts</a>. Founded in 1895, the publication continued its 
                            legacy until 1964. Over many decades, this magazine played a pivotal role in the
                            Italian art scene. This magazine fell within the category of illustrated 
                            publications and drew its initial inspiration from the English magazine "The 
                            Studio: An Illustrated Magazine of Fine and Applied Art," which made its debut 
                            in London in 1893. As time went on, "Emporium" continued to draw inspiration from
                            other publications of a similar genre, particularly the German magazines such 
                            as "Pan" (established in Berlin in 1895) and <a url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugend_(magazine)">"Jugend – Münchner illustrierte
                            Wochenschrift für Kunst und Leben" (first published in Munich in 1896).
                            Characteristic of Emporium are the covers, which change from month to month and reflect the styles and tastes of the time.
                            The covers of the first yearʼs issue were entrusted to Gabriele Chiattone, head of the Bergamasque Instituteʼs
                           drawing room, with the theme being that of <a url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_Magazine">
                           Century Magazine</a>, published in New York and London. In the following years, thanks also to the improvement 
                           of printing methods and paper substrates, there was a shift to ever more vivid colours.
                           In this examination, the focus is on the 1987 edition of "Emporium" magazine, 
                           with particular emphasis on the cover designs from June to December.

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p>The third style is <b>Futurism</b>. I drew inspiration from the central ideas 
                            of this movement: dynamism, revolution, and chaos. Specifically, my inspiration was derived from the painter, sculptor,
                             designer, and illustrator <b>Fortunato Depero</b>, as well as Marinetti himself. I considered some of Depero's works, with a 
                             particular focus on the graphics and typography of his renowned "Bolted Book." <br>

                              <a href="https://www.pinterest.it/elizastuglik6798/renaissance/"><i class="fab fa-pinterest fa-2x"></i></a><br>

                             Regarding fonts, I selected <b>Square font</b> for the navbar, the metadata button, and the title on the homepage. This choice is reminiscent of the blocky 
                             lettering on Depero's book title, further emphasized by the background image on the homepage, which pays homage to Depero's book cover. 
                             For the main text, I opted for the <b>Sitka font</b>, mirroring the book's typography.

                        The actual title of the page, however, is set in Roboto. Rather than emphasizing the font itself, I focused on its effects. The first part of the title features letters
                        positioned differently from one another, creating a sense of randomness and dynamism. This is achieved using CSS transformations, giving each letter its unique position 
                        and orientation.

                            The second part of the title takes a different approach, emphasizing the typographical style of Futurism with shadows that add depth and movement. The overlapping technique, 
                            combined with the shadow effects, creates a sense of depth and motion characteristic of Futurist typographic style.

                            In essence, while Roboto, being faithful to the simplicity and linearity of Futurist fonts, serves as a straightforward font choice, the CSS styling amplifies the chaos and 
                            dynamism inherent in the Futurist style.

                             For the article layouts, I was once again influenced by the "Bolted Book." I partitioned the text into paragraphs of
                            varying sizes, each oriented differently, and adorned with uniquely dimensioned borders. These borders differ in 
                            their placement, sometimes framing the top and bottom, other times the left and right, all presented elegantly.

                            I've also played with the size and thickness of words, a typical Futuristic trait. As a result, the text exudes an essence of chaos 
                            and non-linearity.


                            I sought to accentuate these characteristics even more in the title, drawing inspiration from Depero's design for the 1928 Strega liqueur. 
                            From this and other Futurist works, I embraced the idea of crafting an irregular shape for the title, basing it on a zig-zag pattern and 
                            incorporating various colors.

                            Examining the color palette, black is undoubtedly the dominant shade. Black played a significant role in Futurism, especially during its early years. 
                            It symbolizes modernity, energy, and dynamism and is essential for creating contrast with other colors, emphasizing shapes. I've chosen a purely 
                            black background adorned with white lines radiating from a central point, producing a perspective and depth effect. This design invokes motion, three-dimensionality, 
                            and dynamism—core elements of Futurism. The remainder of the palette leans towards the Futurist inclination to use vibrant colors as a response to industrialization, 
                            breaking from the past and opposing naturalism. This sentiment is evident in Depero's works, such as his design for Strega liqueur, from which I derived the purple 
                            and green shades, while the orange is borrowed both from there and the "Bolted Book." The background colors for the texts and the navbar were inspired by
                             the standard text hues in Depero's book, reminiscent of the traditional Futurist manifesto backdrop.


                             Throughout the page, I've experimented with dimensions and rotations—creating a non-linear title and utilizing shadows for the subtitle. 
                             To echo a quintessential Futurist feature, I incorporated the "mix-blend-mode" property into the title texts, alluding to the Futurist 
                             hallmark of overlapping and merging shapes and images.

                            Another noteworthy aspect is the presence of various animations: the title's letter movements, color-changing letters in the navbar upon hover, 
                            background animations 
                            for the metadata button, and the recurring "click" word across the page. The latter aims to evoke the Futurist's frequent use of onomatopoeias, 
                            intended to break tradition and depict modern reality, as seen in Marinetti's "Zang Tumb Tumb." The choice of the word "click" serves a dual
                             purpose: it's relevant in the web context and symbolizes modernity, reminiscent of computer interactions.
