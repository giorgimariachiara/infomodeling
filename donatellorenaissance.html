George</span> in armour,
                                in the head of which there may be seen the beauty of youth, courage and valour in arms, and a proud and terrible ardour; and
                                there is a marvellous suggestion of life bursting out of the stone. It is certain that no modern figure in marble has yet shown
                                such vivacity and such spirit as nature and art produced in this one by means of the hand of <span class="personName" data-person-id="">Donato</span>.
                                In the base that supports the shrine enclosing that figure he wrought in marble the story of the Saint killing the Dragon, in low-relief,
                                wherein there is a horse that is much esteemed and greatly extolled; and in the frontal he made a half-length figure
                                of <span class="personName" data-person-id="god">God the Father</span> in low-relief. Opposite to the church of the said oratory
                                he wrought the marble shrine for the Mercatanzia, following the ancient Order
                                known as Corinthian, and departing entirely from the German manner; this shrine was meant to contain two statues, but he refused
                                to make them because he could not come to an agreement about the price. After his death, these figures were made in bronze
                                by <span class="personName" data-person-id="andrea">Andrea del Verrocchio</span>, as it will be told. For the main front of
                                <span class="placeName" data-place-id="">the Campanile of S. Maria del Fiore</span> he wrought four figures in marble, five braccia in height,
                                of which the two in the middle are portrayed from life, one being <span class="personName" data-person-id="">Francesco Soderini</span>
                                as a youth, and the other <span class="personName" data-person-id="">Giovanni di Barduccio Cherichini</span>,
                                now called <span class="personName" data-person-id="">Il Zuccone</span>.[21] The latter was held to be a very rare work and the most beautiful
                                that <span class="personName" data-person-id="">Donato</span> ever made, and when he wished to take an oath that would command belief,
                                he was wont to say, "By the faith that I place in my <span class="personName" data-person-id="">Zuccone</span>"; and the while that he was
                                working on it, he would keep gazing at it and saying, "Speak, speak,
                                [Pg 244]
                                plague take thee, speak!" Over the door of the campanile, on the side facing the <span class="placeName" data-place-id="">Canon's house</span>, he
                                made <span class="personName" data-person-id="">Abraham</span> about to sacrifice <span class="personName" data-person-id="">Isaac</span>,
                                with another Prophet: and these figures were placed between two other statues.

                                For the of that city he made a casting in metal which was placed under an arch of
                                their <span class="placeName" data-place-id="loggia">Loggia in the Piazza</span>,
                                representing <span class="personName" data-person-id="judith">Judith</span> cutting off the head
                                of <span class="personName" data-person-id="holofernes">Holofernes</span>; a work of great excellence and mastery, which, if one considers the simplicity
                                of the garments and aspect of <span class="personName" data-person-id="judith">Judith</span> on the surface, reveals very clearly below the surface
                                the great spirit of that woman and the assistance given to her by <span class="personName" data-person-id="god">God</span>, even as one sees the
                                effect of wine and sleep in the expression of <span class="personName" data-person-id="holofernes">Holofernes</span>, and death in his limbs, which have
                                lost all life and are shown cold and limp. This work was so well executed by <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Donato</span> that the
                                casting came out delicate and very beautiful, and it was afterwards finished so excellently that it is a very great marvel to behold. The base,
                                likewise, which is a baluster of granite, simple in design, appears full of grace and presents an aspect pleasing to the eye. He was so well
                                satisfied with this work that he deigned to place his name on it, which he had not done on the others; and it is seen in these words, "Donatelli opus."
                                In the courtyard of the <span class="placeName" data-place-id="">Palace of the said Signori there is a
                                life-size <span class="personName" data-person-id="sculpture">David</span>, nude and in bronze. Having cut off the head
                                of <span class="personName" data-person-id="">Goliath</span>, he is raising one foot and placing it on him, holding a sword in his right hand.
                                This figure is so natural in its vivacity and its softness, that it is almost impossible for craftsmen to believe that it was not moulded on the
                                living form. This statue once stood in the courtyard of the <span class="placeName" data-place-id="medici">house of the Medici</span>, but it was
                                transported to the said place on the exile of <span class="personName" data-person-id="cosimo">Cosimo</span>.
                                In our own day <span class="personName" data-person-id="cosimo">Duke Cosimo</span>, having made a fountain on the spot occupied by this statue,
                                had it removed, and it is being kept for a very large courtyard that he intends to make at the back of the palace, that is, where the lions
                                formerly stood. In the hall where there is the clock of <span class="personName" data-person-id="">Lorenzo della Volpaia</span>, on the left,
                                there is a very beautiful <span class="personName" data-person-id="sculpture">David</span> in marble; between his legs, under his feet, he has the head
                                of the dead <span class="personName" data-person-id="goliath">Goliath</span>, and in his hand he holds the sling wherewith he slew him. In the first
                                courtyard of the <span class="placeName" data-place-id="medici">house of the Medici</span> there are
                                [Pg 245]
                                eight medallions of marble, wherein there are copies of ancient cameos and of the reverse sides of medals, with certain scenes, all made
                                by him and very beautiful, which are built into the frieze between the windows and the architrave above the arches of the loggie. In like
                                manner, he restored an ancient statue of <span class="personName" data-person-id="marsyas">Marsyas</span> in white marble, which was placed at
                                the entrance of the garden; and a great number of ancient heads, which were placed over the doors, were restored and embellished by him
                                with wings and diamonds (the emblem of <span class="personName" data-person-id="cosimo">Cosimo</span>), wrought very well in stucco. He made a
                                very lovely vessel of granite, which poured forth water, and he wrought a similar one, which also pours forth water, for the
                                <span class="placeName" data-place-id="florence">garden of the Pazzi in Florence</span>. In the said
                                <span class="placeName" data-place-id="medici">Palace of the Medici</span> there are Madonnas of marble and bronze made in low-relief,
                                besides some scenes in marble with most beautiful figures, marvellous in their flat-relief. So great was the love
                                that <span class="personName" data-person-id="cosimo">Cosimo</span> bore to the talent of <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Donato</span>
                                that he kept him continually at work, and <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Donato</span>, on the other hand, bore so great love
                                to <span class="personName" data-person-id="cosimo">Cosimo</span> that he could divine his patron's every wish from the slightest sign and obeyed
                                him in all things.
                            </p>

                            <p class="mb-0 aquilineta">
                                It is said that a <span class="placeName" data-place-id="genoese">Genoese merchant</span> caused <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Donato</span>
                                to make a lifesize head of bronze, which was very beautiful and also very light, because it had to be carried to a great distance;
                                and that the commission for this work came to him through the recommendation of <span class="personName" data-person-id="cosimo">Cosimo</span>.
                                Now, when the head was finished and the merchant came to pay for it, it appeared to him that <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Donato</span>
                                was asking too much; wherefore the matter was referred to <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Cosimo</span>, who had the head carried to
                                the upper court of the palace and placed between the battlements that overlook the street, to the end that it might be seen better.
                                When <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Cosimo</span> sought to settle the difference, he found the offer of the merchant very far
                                from the demand of <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Donato</span>, and he turned round and said that it was too little. Whereupon
                                the merchant, thinking it too much, said that <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Donato</span> had wrought it in a month or little more,
                                and that this meant a gain of more than half a florin a day. <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Donato</span>, thinking this too much of
                                an insult, turned round in anger and said to the merchant that in the hundredth part of an hour he would have been able to spoil the value of a
                                year's labour; and giving the head a push, he sent it flying straightway
                                [Pg 246]
                                into the street below, where it broke into a thousand pieces; saying to him that this showed that he was more used to bargaining for beans than
                                for statues. Wherefore the merchant, regretting his meanness, offered to give him double the sum if he would make another; but neither his
                                promises nor the entreaties of <span class="personName" data-person-id="cosimo">Cosimo</span> could
                                induce <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Donato</span> to make it again. In the <span class="placeName" data-place-id="martelli">houses of
                                the Martelli</span> there are many scenes in marble and in bronze; among others,
                                a <span class="personName" data-person-id="sculpture">David</span> three braccia high, with many other works presented by him as a free gift
                                to that family in proof of the devotion and love that he bore them; above all, a <span class="personName" data-person-id="sculpture">S. John</span>
                                of marble, made by him in the round and three braccia high, a very rare work, which is to-day in the house of the heirs
                                of <span class="personName" data-person-id="martelli">Ruberto Martelli</span>. With regard to this work, a legal agreement was made to the effect
                                that it should be neither pledged, nor sold, nor given away, without heavy penalties, as a testimony and token of the affection shown by
                                them to <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Donato</span>, and by him to them out of gratitude that he had learnt his art through
                                the protection and the opportunities that he received from them.

                                He also made a tomb of marble for an <span class="personName" data-person-id="sculpture">Archbishop</span>, which was sent
                                to <span class="placeName" data-place-id="naples">Naples</span> and is in <span class="placeName" data-place-id="tomb">S. Angelo di Seggio di Nido</span>;
                                in this tomb there are three figures in the round that support the sarcophagus with their heads, and on the sarcophagus itself is a scene in
                                low-relief, so beautiful that it commands infinite praise. In the house of the <span class="placeName" data-place-id="matalone">Count of Matalone</span>,
                                in the same city, there is the head of a horse by the hand of <span class="personName" data-person-id="donato">Donato</span>, so beautiful that many
                                take it for an antique. In the township of <span class="placeName" data-place-id="prato">Prato</span> he wrought the marble pulpit where the
                                <span class="personName" data-person-id="sculpture">Girdle</span> is shown, in which, in several compartments,
                                he carved a dance of children so beautiful and so admirable, that he may be said to have demonstrated the perfection of his art no less in this
                                work than in his others. To support this pulpit, moreover, he made two capitals of bronze, one of which is still there, while the other
                                was carried away by the <span class="personName" data-person-id="">Spaniards</span> who sacked that district.
