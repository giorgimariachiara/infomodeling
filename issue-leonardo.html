                            <p>The greatest gifts are often seen, in the course of nature, rained by celestial influences on human creatures; and sometimes,
                            in supernatural fashion, beauty, grace, and talent are united beyond measure in one single person, in a manner that to whatever
                            such one turns his attention, his every action is so divine, that, surpassing all other men, it makes itself clearly known as a thing bestowed
                            by <span class="personName">God</span> (as it is), and not acquired by human art. This was seen by all mankind in <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo da Vinci</span>,
                            in whom, besides a beauty of body never sufficiently extolled, there was an infinite grace in all his actions; and so great was his genius, and such its growth, that to whatever difficulties
                            he turned his mind, he solved them with ease. In him was great bodily strength, joined to dexterity, with a spirit and courage ever royal and magnanimous;
                            and the fame of his name so increased, that not only in his lifetime was he held in esteem, but his reputation became even greater among posterity after his death.</p>

                        <p>Truly marvellous and celestial was <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span>,
                            the son of <span class="personName" data-person-id="piero">Ser Piero da Vinci</span>; and in learning and in the rudiments of
                            letters he would have made great proficience, if he had not been so variable and unstable, for he set himself to learn many things,
                            and then, after having begun them, abandoned them. Thus, in arithmetic, during the few months that he studied it,
                            he made so much progress, that, by continually suggesting [Pg 90]doubts and difficulties to the master who was teaching him,
                            he would very often bewilder him. He gave some little attention to music, and quickly resolved to learn to play the lyre, as one who
                            had by nature a spirit most lofty and full of refinement: wherefore he sang divinely to that instrument, improvising upon it. Nevertheless,
                            although he occupied himself with such a variety of things, he never ceased drawing and working in relief, pursuits which suited his fancy
                            more than any other. Ser Piero, having observed this, and having considered the loftiness of his intellect, one day took some of his drawings
                            and carried them to <span class="personName" data-person-id="andrea">Andrea del Verrocchio</span>, who was much his friend, and besought him straitly to
                            tell him whether <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span>, by devoting himself to drawing, would make any proficience. <span class="personName" data-person-id="andrea">Andrea</span>
                            was astonished to see the extraordinary beginnings of <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span>, and urged <span class="personName" data-person-id="piero">Ser Piero</span>
                            that he should make him study it; wherefore he arranged with <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> that he should enter the workshop of Andrea,
                            which <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> did with the greatest willingness in the world. And he practised not one branch of art only, but all those in which drawing played a part; and having an
                            intellect so divine and marvellous that he was also an excellent geometrician, he not only worked in sculpture, making in his youth, in clay, some heads of women
                            that are smiling, of which plaster casts are still taken, and likewise some heads of boys which appeared to have issued from the hand of a master;
                            but in architecture, also, he made many drawings both of ground-plans and of other designs of buildings; and he was the first, although but a youth,
                            who suggested the plan of reducing the <span class="placeName" data-place-id="arno">river Arno</span> to a navigable canal from <span class="placeName" data-place-id="pisa">Pisa</span>
                            to <span class="placeName" data-place-id="florence">Florence</span>. He made designs of flour-mills, fulling-mills, and engines, which might be driven by the force of water: and since he wished that his profession should be painting,
                            he studied much in drawing after nature, and sometimes in making models of figures in clay, over which he would lay soft pieces of cloth dipped in clay, and then set himself
                            patiently to draw them on a certain kind of very fine Rheims cloth, or prepared linen: and he executed them in black and white with the point of
                            his brush, so that it was a marvel, as some of them by his hand, which I have in our book of drawings, still bear witness; besides which,
                            he drew on paper with such diligence and so well, that there is [Pg 91]no one who has ever equalled him in perfection of finish; and I have one,
                            a head drawn with the style in chiaroscuro, which is divine.</p>

                        <p>And there was infused in that brain such grace from <span class="personName">God</span>, and a power of expression in such sublime accord with the intellect and memory that served it,
                            and he knew so well how to express his conceptions by draughtsmanship, that he vanquished with his discourse, and confuted with his reasoning,
                            every valiant wit. And he was continually making models and designs to show men how to remove mountains with ease, and how to bore them in order
                            to pass from one level to another; and by means of levers, windlasses, and screws, he showed the way to raise and draw great weights,
                            together with methods for emptying harbours, and pumps for removing water from low places, things which his brain never ceased from devising;
                            and of these ideas and labours many drawings may be seen, scattered abroad among our craftsmen; and I myself have seen not a few. He even went
                            so far as to waste his time in drawing knots of cords, made according to an order, that from one end all the rest might follow till the other,
                            so as to fill a round; and one of these is to be seen in stamp, most difficult and beautiful, and in the middle of it are these words,
                            "Leonardus Vinci <span class="placeName">Accademia</span>." And among these models and designs, there was one by which he often demonstrated to many ingenious citizens,
                            who were then governing <span class="placeName" data-place-id="florence">Florence</span>, how he proposed to raise the <span class="placeName" data-place-id="florence">Temple of S. Giovanni</span>
                            in <span class="placeName" data-place-id="florence">Florence</span>, and place steps under it, without damaging the building; and with such strong
                            reasons did he urge this, that it appeared possible, although each man, after he had departed, would recognize for himself the impossibility of so vast an undertaking.
                        </p>
                        <p>He was so pleasing in conversation, that he attracted to himself the hearts of men. And although he possessed, one might say, nothing, and worked little,
                            he always kept servants and horses, in which latter he took much delight, and particularly in all other animals, which he managed with the greatest
                            love and patience; and this he showed when often passing by the places where birds were sold, for, taking them with his own hand out of their cages,
                            and having paid to those who sold them the price that was asked, he let them fly away into the air, restoring to [Pg 92]them their lost liberty.
                            For which reason nature was pleased so to favour him, that, wherever he turned his thought, brain, and mind, he displayed such divine power in his
                            works, that, in giving them their perfection, no one was ever his peer in readiness, vivacity, excellence, beauty, and grace.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is clear that <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span>, through his comprehension of art, began many things and never finished one of them, since it seemed to him that the hand was not able
                            to attain to the perfection of art in carrying out the things which he imagined; for the reason that he conceived in idea difficulties so subtle and
                            so marvellous, that they could never be expressed by the hands, be they ever so excellent. And so many were his caprices, that, philosophizing of natural
                            things, he set himself to seek out the properties of herbs, going on even to observe the motions of the heavens, the path of the moon, and the courses of the sun.
                        </p>
                        <p>He was placed, then, as has been said, in his boyhood, at the instance of <span class="personName" data-person-id="piero">Ser Piero</span>,
                            to learn art with <span class="personName" data-person-id="verrochio">Andrea del Verrocchio</span>, who was making a
                            panel-picture of <span class="placeName">S. John</span> baptizing <span class="personName">Christ</span>,
                            when <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> painted an angel who was holding some garments; and although he was but a lad,
                            <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> executed it in such a manner that his angel was much better than the figures of <span class="personName" data-person-id="andrea">Andrea</span>;
                            which was the reason that <span class="personName" data-person-id="andrea">Andrea</span> would never again touch colour, in disdain that a child should know more than he.
                        </p>

                        <p>He was commissioned to make a cartoon for a door-hanging that was to be executed in <span class="placeName">Flanders</span>, woven in gold and silk, to be sent to
                            the <span class="personName" data-person-id="king">King</span> of <span class="placeName" data-place-id="portugal">Portugal</span>, of
                            <span class="personName">Adam and Eve</span> sinning in the <span class="placeName">Earthly Paradise</span>; wherein <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> drew
                            with the brush in chiaroscuro, with the lights in lead-white, a meadow of infinite kinds of herbage, with some animals, of which, in truth,
                            it may be said that for diligence and truth to nature divine wit could not make it so perfect. In it is the fig-tree, together with the foreshortening of the
                            leaves and the varying aspects of the branches, wrought with such lovingness that the brain reels at the mere thought how a man could have such patience.
                            There is also a palm-tree which has the radiating crown of the palm, executed with such great and marvellous art that nothing save the patience and intellect
                            of <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> could avail to do it. This work was carried no farther; wherefore the cartoon is now at <span class="placeName" data-person-id="florence">Florence</span>, in the blessed house of the Magnificent
                            [Pg 93]<span class="personName" data-person-id="medici">Ottaviano de' Medici</span>, presented to him not long ago by the uncle of <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span>.
                        </p>

                        <p>It is said that <span class="personName" data-person-id="piero">Ser Piero da Vinci</span>, being at his villa, was besought as a favour, by a peasant of his,
                            who had made a buckler with his own hands out of a fig-tree that he had cut down on the farm, to have it painted for him in <span class="placeName" data-person-id="florence">Florence</span>, which he did very willingly,
                            since the countryman was very skilful at catching birds and fishing, and Ser Piero made much use of him in these pursuits. Thereupon, having had it taken
                            to <span class="placeName" data-place-id="florence">Florence</span>, without saying a word to <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> as to whose it was, he asked him to paint something upon it.
                            <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span>, having one day taken this buckler in his hands, and seeing it twisted, badly made, and clumsy,
                            straightened it by the fire, and, having given it to a turner, from the rude and clumsy thing that it was, caused it to be made smooth and even.
                            And afterwards, having given it a coat of gesso, and having prepared it in his own way, he began to think what he could paint upon it, that might
                            be able to terrify all who should come upon it, producing the same effect as once did the head of <span class="personName" data-person-id="medusa">Medusa</span>. For this purpose, then, <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> carried to a
                            room of his own into which no one entered save himself alone, lizards great and small, crickets, serpents, butterflies, grasshoppers, bats, and
                            other strange kinds of suchlike animals, out of the number of which, variously put together, he formed a great ugly creature, most horrible and
                            terrifying, which emitted a poisonous breath and turned the air to flame; and he made it coming out of a dark and jagged rock, belching forth venom
                            from its open throat, fire from its eyes, and smoke from its nostrils, in so strange a fashion that it appeared altogether a monstrous and horrible thing;
                            and so long did he labour over making it, that the stench of the dead animals in that room was past bearing, but <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> did not notice it, so great
                            was the love that he bore towards art. The work being finished, although it was no longer asked for either by the countryman or by his father,
                            <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> told the latter that he might send for the buckler at his convenience, since, for his part, it was finished. <span class="personName" data-person-id="piero">Ser Piero</span> having therefore
                            gone one morning to the room for the buckler, and having knocked at the door, Leonardo opened to him, telling him to wait a little; and, having
                            gone back into the room, he adjusted the [Pg 94]buckler in a good light on the easel, and put to the window, in order to make a soft light, and
                            then he bade him come in to see it. <span class="personName" data-person-id="piero">Ser Piero</span>, at the first glance, taken by surprise, gave a sudden start, not thinking that that was the buckler,
                            nor merely painted the form that he saw upon it, and, falling back a step, <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> checked him, saying, "This work serves the end for which it was
                            made; take it, then, and carry it away, since this is the effect that it was meant to produce." This thing appeared to Ser Piero nothing short of a
                            miracle, and he praised very greatly the ingenious idea of <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span>; and then, having privately bought from a pedlar another buckler, painted with
                            a heart transfixed by an arrow, he presented it to the countryman, who remained obliged to him for it as long as he lived. Afterwards, <span class="personName" data-person-id="piero">Ser Piero</span>
                            sold the buckler of <span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> secretly to some merchants in <span class="placeName" data-person-id="florence">Florence</span>, for a hundred ducats; and in a short time it came into the hands of
                            the <span class="personName" data-person-id="duke">Duke</span> of <span class="placeName" data-person-id="milan">Milan</span>, having been sold to him by the said merchants for three hundred ducats.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="personName" data-person-id="leo">Leonardo</span> then made a picture of Our Lady, a most excellent work, which was in the possession of
                            <span class="personName" data-person-id="pope">Pope Clement VII</span>; and, among other things painted therein, he counterfeited a glass vase full of water,
                            containing some flowers, in which, besides its marvellous naturalness, he had imitated the dew-drops on the flowers, so that it seemed
                            more real than the reality. For <span class="personName" data-person-id="antonio">Antonio Segni</span>, who was very much his friend, he made, on a sheet of paper,
                            a Neptune executed with such careful draughtsmanship that it seemed absolutely alive. In it one saw the ocean troubled, and Neptune's car
                            drawn by sea-horses, with fantastic creatures, marine monsters and winds, and some very beautiful heads of sea-gods. This drawing was presented by
                            <span class="personName">Fabio</span>, the son of <span class="personName" data-person-id="antonio">Antonio</span>, to <span class="personName" data-person-id="giovanni">Messer Giovanni Gaddi</span>,
                            with this epigram:

                        <p>The fancy came to him to paint a picture in oils of the head of a Medusa, with the head attired with a coil of snakes, the most strange [Pg 95]and
                            extravagant invention that could ever be imagined; but since it was a work that took time, it remained unfinished, as happened with almost all his things.
                            It is among the rare works of art in the <span class="placeName">Palace of Duke Cosimo</span>, together with the head of an angel, who is raising one arm
                            in the air, which, coming forward, is foreshortened from the shoulder to the elbow, and with the other he raises the hand to the breast.</p>

                        <p>It is an extraordinary thing how that genius, in his desire to give the highest relief to the works that he made, went so far with dark shadows,
                            in order to find the darkest possible grounds, that he sought for blacks which might make deeper shadows and be darker than other blacks, that by
                            their means he might make his lights the brighter; and in the end this method turned out so dark, that, no light remaining there, his pictures had
                            rather the character of things made to represent an effect of night, than the clear quality of daylight; which all came from seeking to give greater
                            relief, and to achieve the final perfection of art.</p>

                        <p>He was so delighted when he saw certain bizarre heads of men, with the beard or hair growing naturally, that he would follow one that pleased him a
                            whole day, and so treasured him up in idea, that afterwards, on arriving home, he drew him as if he had had him in his presence. Of this sort there
                            are many heads to be seen, both of women and of men, and I have several of them, drawn by his hand with the pen, in our book of drawings, which I
                            have mentioned so many times; such was that of <span class="personName">Amerigo Vespucci</span>, which is a very beautiful head of an old man
                            drawn with charcoal, and likewise that of <span class="personName">Scaramuccia</span>, Captain of the Gypsies, which afterwards came into the
                            hands of <span class="personName">M. Donato Valdambrini</span> of <span class="placeName">Arezzo</span>, Canon of <span class="placeName">S. Lorenzo</span>,
                            left to him by <span class="personName">Giambullari</span>.</p>
                        <p>He began a panel-picture of the Adoration of the Magi, containing many beautiful things, particularly the heads, which was in the house
                            of <span class="personName">Amerigo Benci</span>, opposite the <span class="placeName">Loggia de' Peruzzi</span>; and this, also, remained
                            unfinished, like his other works.</p>
                        <p>It came to pass that <span class="personName">Giovan Galeazzo</span>, Duke of Milan, being dead, and <span class="personName">Lodovico Sforza</span>
                            raised to the same rank, in the year 1494, <span class="personName">Leonardo</span> was summoned to <span class="placeName">Milan</span> in great
                            repute to the Duke, who took much delight in the sound of the lyre, to the end that he might play it: and [Pg 96]<span class="personName">Leonardo</span>
                            took with him that instrument which he had made with his own hands, in great part of silver, in the form of a horse's skullâ€”a thing bizarre and newâ€”in
                            order that the harmony might be of greater volume and more sonorous in tone; with which he surpassed all the musicians who had come together there to play.
                            Besides this, he was the best improviser in verse of his day. The Duke, hearing the marvellous discourse of <span class="personName">Leonardo</span>,
                            became so enamoured of his genius, that it was something incredible: and he prevailed upon him by entreaties to paint an altar-panel containing a Nativity,
                            which was sent by the Duke to the Emperor.</p>

                        <p>He also painted in <span class="placeName">Milan</span>, for the Friars of <span class="placeName">S. Dominic</span>, at
                            <span class="placeName">S. Maria delle Grazie</span>, a Last Supper, a most beautiful and marvellous thing; and to the heads of the Apostles
                            he gave such majesty and beauty, that he left the head of Christ unfinished, not believing that he was able to give it that divine air which
                            is essential to the image of Christ. This work, remaining thus all but finished, has ever been held by the Milanese in the greatest veneration,
                            and also by strangers as well; for <span class="personName">Leonardo</span> imagined and succeeded in expressing that anxiety which had seized the
                            Apostles in wishing to know who should betray their Master. For which reason in all their faces are seen love, fear, and wrath, or rather, sorrow,
                            at not being able to understand the meaning of Christ; which thing excites no less marvel than the sight, in contrast to it, of obstinacy, hatred,
                            and treachery in <span class="personName">Judas</span>; not to mention that every least part of the work displays an incredible diligence, seeing
                            that even in the tablecloth the texture of the stuff is counterfeited in such a manner that linen itself could not seem more real.</p>

                        <p>It is said that the Prior of that place kept pressing <span class="personName">Leonardo</span>, in a most importunate manner, to finish the work;
                            for it seemed strange to him to see <span class="personName">Leonardo</span> sometimes stand half a day at a time, lost in contemplation, and he
                            would have liked him to go on like the labourers hoeing in his garden, without ever stopping his brush. And not content with this, he complained
                            of it to the Duke, and that so warmly, that he was constrained to send for <span class="personName">Leonardo</span> and delicately urged him to
                            work, contriving nevertheless to show him that he was doing all this because [Pg 97]of the importunity of the Prior. <span class="personName">Leonardo</span>,
                            knowing that the intellect of that Prince was acute and discerning, was pleased to discourse at large with the Duke on the subject, a thing which he had never
                            done with the Prior: and he reasoned much with him about art, and made him understand that men of lofty genius sometimes accomplish the most when they work
                            the least, seeking out inventions with the mind, and forming those perfect ideas which the hands afterwards express and reproduce from the images already
                            conceived in the brain. And he added that two heads were still wanting for him to paint; that of Christ, which he did not wish to seek on earth; and he
                            could not think that it was possible to conceive in the imagination that beauty and heavenly grace which should be the mark of God incarnate. Next, there
                            was wanting that of <span class="personName">Judas</span>, which was also troubling him, not thinking himself capable of imagining features that should
                            represent the countenance of him who, after so many benefits received, had a mind so cruel as to resolve to betray his Lord, the Creator of the world.
                            However, he would seek out a model for the latter; but if in the end he could not find a better, he should not want that of the importunate and tactless
                            Prior. This thing moved the Duke wondrously to laughter, and he said that <span class="personName">Leonardo</span> had a thousand reasons on his side.
                            And so the poor Prior, in confusion, confined himself to urging on the work in the garden, and left <span class="personName">Leonardo</span> in peace,
                            who finished only the head of <span class="personName">Judas</span>, which seems the very embodiment of treachery and inhumanity; but that of Christ,
                            as has been said, remained unfinished. The nobility of this picture, both because of its design, and from its having been wrought with an incomparable
                            diligence, awoke a desire in the <span class="personName">King of France</span> to transport it into his kingdom; wherefore he tried by all possible
                            means to discover whether there were architects who, with cross-stays of wood and iron, might have been able to make it so secure that it might be
                            transported safely; without considering any expense that might have been involved thereby, so much did he desire it. But the fact of its being painted
                            on the wall robbed his Majesty of his desire; and the picture remained with the <span class="placeName">Milanese</span>. In the same refectory, while he
                            was working at the Last Supper, on the end wall where is a Passion in the old manner, <span class="personName">Leonardo</span> portrayed the
                            [Pg 98]said <span class="personName">Lodovico</span>, with <span class="personName">Massimiliano</span>, his eldest son; and, on the other side,
                            the <span class="personName">Duchess Beatrice</span>, with <span class="personName">Francesco</span>, their other son, both of whom afterwards
                            became Dukes of <span class="placeName">Milan</span>; and all are portrayed divinely well.</p>

                        <p>While he was engaged on this work, he proposed to the <span class="personName">Duke</span> to make a horse in bronze, of a marvellous greatness,
                            in order to place upon it, as a memorial, the image of the <span class="personName">Duke</span>. And on so vast a scale did he begin it and continue it,
                            that it could never be completed. And there are those who have been of the opinion (so various and so often malign out of envy are the judgments of men)
                            that he began it with no intention of finishing it, because, being of so great a size, an incredible difficulty was encountered in seeking to cast it
                            in one piece; and it might also be believed that, from the result, many may have formed such a judgment, since many of his works have remained unfinished.
                            But, in truth, one can believe that his vast and most excellent mind was hampered through being too full of desire, and that his wish ever to seek out
                            excellence upon excellence, and perfection upon perfection, was the reason of it. "Tal che l' opera fosse ritardata dal desio," as
                            our <span class="personName">Petrarca</span> has said. And, indeed, those who saw the great model that <span class="personName">Leonardo</span>
                            made in clay vow that they have never seen a more beautiful thing, or a more superb; and it was preserved until the French came
                            to <span class="placeName">Milan</span> with <span class="personName">King Louis of France</span>, and broke it all to pieces. Lost, also,
                            is a little model of it in wax, which was held to be perfect, together with a book on the anatomy of the horse made by him by way of study.</p>

                        <p>He then applied himself, but with greater care, to the anatomy of man, assisted by and in turn assisting, in this
                            research, <span class="personName">Messer Marc' Antonio della Torre</span>, an excellent philosopher, who was then lecturing
                            at <span class="placeName">Pavia</span>, and who wrote of this matter; and he was one of the first (as I have heard tell) that
                            began to illustrate the problems of medicine with the doctrine of <span class="personName">Galen</span>, and to throw true light
                            on anatomy, which up to that time had been wrapped in the thick and gross darkness of ignorance. And in this he found marvellous
                            aid in the brain, work, and hand of <span class="personName">Leonardo</span>, who made a book drawn in red chalk, and annotated with
                            the pen, of the bodies that he dissected with his own hand, and drew with the greatest diligence; wherein he showed all the frame of
                            the [Pg 99]bones; and then added to them, in order, all the nerves, and covered them with muscles; the first attached to the bone, the
                            second that hold the body firm, and the third that move it; and beside them, part by part, he wrote in letters of an ill-shaped character,
                            which he made with the left hand, backwards; and whoever is not practised in reading them cannot understand them, since they are not to be
                            read save with a mirror. Of these papers on the anatomy of man, a great part is in the hands of <span class="personName">Messer Francesco da Melzo</span>,
                            a gentleman of <span class="placeName">Milan</span>, who in the time of <span class="personName">Leonardo</span> was a very beautiful boy, and
                            much beloved by him, and now is a no less beautiful and gentle old man; and he holds them dear, and keeps such papers together as if they were
                            relics, in company with the portrait of <span class="personName">Leonardo</span> of happy memory; and to all who read these writings, it seems
                            impossible that that divine spirit should have discoursed so well of art, and of the muscles, nerves, and veins, and with such diligence of
                            everything. So, also, there are in the hands of <span class="personName">â€”â€”,[11]</span> a painter of <span class="placeName">Milan</span>,
                            certain writings of <span class="personName">Leonardo</span>, likewise in characters written with the left hand, backwards, which treat of
                            painting, and of the methods of drawing and colouring. This man, not long ago, came to <span class="placeName">Florence</span> to see me,
                            wishing to print this work, and he took it to <span class="placeName">Rome</span>, in order to put it into effect; but I do not know what
                            may afterwards have become of it.</p>

                        <p>And to return to the works of <span class="personName">Leonardo</span>; there came to <span class="placeName">Milan</span>,
                            in his time, the <span class="personName">King of France</span>, wherefore <span class="personName">Leonardo</span> being asked
                            to devise some bizarre thing, made a lion which walked several steps and then opened its breast, and showed it full of lilies.</p>

                        <p>In <span class="placeName">Milan</span> he took for his assistant the Milanese <span class="personName">Salai</span>, who was most
                            comely in grace and beauty, having fine locks, curling in ringlets, in which <span class="personName">Leonardo</span> greatly delighted;
                            and he taught him many things of art; and certain works in <span class="placeName">Milan</span>, which are said to be by <span class="personName">Salai</span>,
                            were retouched by <span class="personName">Leonardo</span>.</p>
