                        		a <span class="placeName" data-place-id="florence">Florentine</span>, was in his day a goldsmith,
				                    a master of perspective, a sculptor, a wood-carver, a painter, and a musician; but in the arts of sculpture and painting,
				                    to tell the truth, he had a manner somewhat hard and crude, as one who acquired it rather by infinite study than by the
				                    facility of a natural gift. Even if he had been as poor in this facility as he was rich in the study and diligence that exalted him,
				                    he would have been most excellent in those arts, which, for their highest perfection, require a union of study and natural power.
				                    If either of these is wanting, a man rarely attains to the first rank; but study will do a great deal,
				                    and thus <span class="personName" data-person-id="andrea">Andrea</span>, who had it in greater abundance than any other craftsman whatsoever, is counted among
				                    the rare and excellent masters of our arts.

					                <p class="mb-0">
					                    In his youth he applied himself to the sciences, particularly to geometry. Among many other things that he made while working at the goldsmith's
					                    art were certain buttons for copes, which are in <span class="placeName">S. Maria del Fiore</span> at <span class="placeName" data-place-id="florence">Florence</span>;
					                    and he also made larger works, particularly a cup, full of animals, foliage, and other bizarre fancies, which is known to all goldsmiths,
					                    and casts are taken of it; and likewise another, on which there is a very beautiful dance of little children. Having given a proof of his
					                    powers in these two works, he was commissioned by the Guild of Merchants to make two scenes in silver for the ends of the altar
					                    of <span class="personName" data-person-id="giovanni">S. Giovanni</span>, from which, when put into execution, he acquired very great praise and fame.
					                </p>

					                <p class="mb-0">
					                    There were wanting at this time in <span class="placeName" data-place-id="rome">Rome</span> some of those large figures
					                    [Pg 268]
					                    of the Apostles which generally stood on the altar of the Chapel of the <span class="personName" data-person-id="pope">Pope</span>,
					                    as well as certain other works in silver that had been destroyed; wherefore <span class="personName" data-person-id="pope">Pope Sixtus</span>
					                    sent for <span class="personName" data-person-id="andrea">Andrea</span> and with great favour commissioned him to do all that was necessary in this matter,
					                    and he brought the whole to perfection with much diligence and judgment. Meanwhile, perceiving that the many antique statues and
					                    other things that were being found in <span class="placeName">Rome</span> were held in very great esteem, insomuch that the famous
					                    bronze horse was set up by the <span class="personName" data-person-id="pope">Pope</span>
					                    at <span class="placeName" data-place-id="S. Giovanni">S. Giovanni Laterano</span>, and that
					                    even the fragments—not to speak of complete works—which were being discovered every day, were prized, <span class="personName" data-person-id="andrea">Andrea</span>
					                    determined to devote himself to sculpture. And so, completely abandoning the goldsmith's art, he set himself to cast some little figures in
					                    bronze, which were greatly extolled. Thereupon, growing in courage, he began to work in marble. Now in those days,
					                    the wife of <span class="personName" data-person-id="francesco">Francesco Tornabuoni</span> had died in childbirth, and her husband, who had loved her much and
					                    wished to honour her in death to the utmost of his power, entrusted the making of a tomb for her to <span class="personName" data-person-id="andrea">Andrea</span>,
					                    who carved on a slab over a sarcophagus of marble the lady herself, her delivery, and her passing to the other life; and beside this, he made
					                    three figures of Virtues, which were held very beautiful, for the first work that he had executed in marble; and this tomb was set up in
					                    the <span class="placeName" data-place-id="minerva">Minerva</span>.
					                </p>
					                
					                <p>
                                        Having then returned to <span class="placeName">Florence</span> with money, fame, and honour, he was commissioned to make a
                                        <span class="personName">David</span> of bronze, two braccia and a half in height, which, when finished, was placed in
                                        the <span class="placeName">Palace</span>, with great credit to himself, at the head of the staircase, where the <span class="personName">Catena</span>
                                        was. The while that he was executing the said statue, he also made that <span class="personName">Madonna</span> of marble which is over the tomb
                                        of <span class="personName">Messer Lionardo Bruni</span> of <span class="placeName">Arezzo</span> in <span class="placeName">S. Croce</span>;
                                        this he wrought, when still quite young, for <span class="personName">Bernardo Rossellino</span>, architect and sculptor, who executed the
                                        whole of that work in marble, as has been said. The same <span class="personName">Andrea</span> made a half-length <span class="personName">Madonna</span>
                                        in half-relief, with the <span class="personName">Child</span> in her arms, in a marble panel, which was formerly in <span class="placeName" data-place-id="medici">the house of
                                        the Medici</span>, and is now placed, as a very beautiful thing, over a door in the apartment of
                                        <span class="placeName" data-place-id="florence">the Duchess of Florence</span>. He also made two heads of metal, likewise
                                        [Pg 269]
                                        in half-relief; one of <span class="personName" data-person-id="alexander">Alexander the Great</span>, in profile, and the other a fanciful portrait
                                        of <span class="personName">Darius</span>; each being a separate work by itself, with variety in the crests, armour, and everything else.
                                        Both these heads were sent to <span class="placeName" data-place-id="hungray">Hungary</span> by the elder <span class="personName" data-person-id="medici">Lorenzo de' Medici</span>,
                                        the <span class="personName">Magnificent</span>, to <span class="personName" data-person-id="king">King Matthias Corvinus</span>, together with many other things,
                                        as will be told in the proper place.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Having acquired the name of an excellent master by means of these works, above all through many works in metal, in which he took much delight,
                                        he made a tomb of bronze in <span class="placeName">S. Lorenzo</span>, wholly in the round, for <span class="personName">Giovanni</span>
                                        and <span class="personName" data-person-id="medici">Pietro di Cosimo de' Medici</span>, with a sarcophagus of porphyry supported by four corner-pieces of bronze,
                                        with twisted foliage very well wrought and finished with the greatest diligence. This tomb stands between the Chapel of the Sacrament and
                                        the Sacristy, and no work could be better done, whether wrought in bronze or cast; above all since at the same time he showed therein his
                                        talent in architecture, for he placed the said tomb within the embrasure of a window which is about five braccia in breadth and ten in height,
                                        and set it on a base that divides the said <span class="placeName">Chapel of the Sacrament</span> from the old Sacristy.
                                        And over the sarcophagus, to fill up the embrasure right up to the vaulting, he made a grating of bronze ropes in a pattern of mandorle, most natural,
                                        and adorned in certain places with festoons and other beautiful things of fancy, all remarkable and executed with much mastery, judgment, and invention.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Now <span class="personName">Donatello</span> had made for the Tribunal of Six of the <span class="personName">Mercanzia</span>
                                        that marble shrine which is now opposite to <span class="placeName">S. Michael</span>, in the Oratory of <span class="placeName">Orsanmichele</span>,
                                        and for this there was to have been made a <span class="personName">S. Thomas</span> in bronze, feeling for the wound in the side of Christ;
                                        but at that time, nothing more was done, for some of the men who had the charge of this wished to have it made by <span class="personName">Donatello</span>,
                                        and others favoured <span class="personName">Lorenzo Ghiberti</span>. Matters stood thus as long as <span class="personName">Donatello</span>
                                        and <span class="personName">Ghiberti</span> were alive; but finally, the said two statues were entrusted to <span class="personName" data-person-id="andrea">Andrea</span>,
                                        who, having made the models and moulds, cast them; and they came out so solid, complete, and well made, that it was a most beautiful casting.
                                        Thereupon, setting himself to polish and finish them, he brought them to
                                        [Pg 270]
                                        that perfection which is seen at the present day, which could not be greater than it is, for in <span class="personName">S. Thomas</span>
                                        we see incredulity and a too great anxiety to assure himself of the truth, and at the same time, the love that makes him lay his hand in a
                                        most beautiful manner on the side of <span class="personName">Christ</span>; and in <span class="personName" data-person-id="christ">Christ</span> Himself, who is
                                        raising one arm and opening His raiment with a most spontaneous gesture, and dispelling the doubts of His incredulous disciple, there are all the grace and divinity, so to speak, that art can give to any figure. <span class="personName">Andrea</span> clothed both these figures in most beautiful and well-arranged draperies, which give us to know that he understood that art no less than did <span class="personName">Donato</span>, <span class="personName">Lorenzo</span>, and the others who had lived before him; wherefore this work well deserved to be set up in a shrine made by <span class="personName">Donatello</span> and to be ever afterwards held in the greatest price and esteem.

                                        Now the fame of <span class="personName" data-person-id="andrea">Andrea</span> could not go further or grow greater in that profession,
                                        and he, as a man who was not content with being excellent in one thing only but desired to become the same in others as well by means of study,
                                        turned his mind to painting. He so made the cartoons for a battle of nude figures, very well drawn with the pen, to be afterwards painted in
                                        colours on a wall. He also made the cartoons for some historical pictures and afterwards began to put them into execution in colours; but for
                                        some reason, whatever it may have been, they remained unfinished. There are some drawings by his hand in our book, made with much patience and
                                        very great judgment. Among these are certain heads of women, beautiful in expression and in the adornment of the hair,
                                        which <span class="personName">Leonardo da Vinci</span> was ever imitating for their beauty. In our book, also, are two horses with the due measures
                                        and protractors for reproducing them on a larger scale from a smaller, so that there may be no errors in their proportions. I possess a horse's head of
                                        terra-cotta in relief, copied from the antique, which is a rare work. The Very Reverend <span class="personName">Don Vincenzio Borghini</span>
                                        has some of his drawings in his book, of which we have spoken above; among others, a design for a tomb made by him in <span class="placeName" data-place-id="venice">Venice</span>
                                        for a <span class="personName">Doge</span>, a scene of the Adoration of Christ by the Magi, and the head of a woman painted on paper with the utmost delicacy.
                                        He also made for <span class="personName" data-person-id="medici">Lorenzo de' Medici</span>,
                                        [Pg 271]
                                        for the fountain of his Villa at <span class="placeName">Careggi</span>, a boy of bronze squeezing a fish, which
                                        the Lord Duke <span class="personName" data-person-id="cosimo">Cosimo</span> has caused to be placed, as may be seen at the present day, on the fountain that is
                                        in the courtyard of his <span class="placeName">Palace</span>; which boy is truly marvellous.
